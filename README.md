# ISSAFE: Improving Semantic Segmentation in Accidents by Fusing Event-based Data


![issafe_demo](demo/issafe.gif)

**ISSAFE**, is a multi-modal semantic segmentation architecture by fusing the RGB image and the event-based data, aiming to improve the model's robustness against driving edge-cases (critical or accidental situations). More details can be found in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08974.pdf). 



## Requirement

TODO



## Datasets

Get dataset from [Cityscapes](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/), and [DADA-2000](https://github.com/JWFangit/LOTVS-DADA). Our proposed DADA-seg dataset is a subset from DADA-2000. Our annotations have the same labeling rule as Cityscapes and will be release soon.
